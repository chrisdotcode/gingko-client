# Gingko Writer [![Web Deploy](https://github.com/gingko/client/actions/workflows/web-deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gingko/client/actions/workflows/web-deploy.yml)

Writing software to help organize and draft complex documents. Anything from novels and screenplays to legal briefs and graduate theses.

This is a ground-up rewrite of [GingkoApp.com](https://gingkoapp.com). The latest version is available online at [gingkowriter.com](https://gingkowriter.com).

The desktop version (on branch [desktop](https://github.com/gingko/client/tree/desktop)), is currently **well behind** the web app version. It will eventually be brought up to par, but if you need it now, it's available to download on [the releases page](https://github.com/gingko/client/releases) (for Linux, Windows, and Mac).

Prerequisites:
